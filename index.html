    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>I'm <strong itemprop="name">{{ site.author.name }}</strong>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer" target="_blank"><em itemprop="jobTitle">{{ site.author.job }}</em></a> from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" target="_blank">Dublin, Ireland</a></em>.</h3>
    <p>I work on mobile projects at <a href="http://kitmanlabs.com" target="_blank">Kitman Labs</a>. The company's first mobile developer, I joined in October 2014. Since then, we've launched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kitman-athlete/id941173941?mt=8" target="_blank">Athlete for iOS</a> and I've worked on overhauling how we recruit our engineers.</p>
    <p>
      Before that I was a founding member of the Developer Support Engineering team at <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, where I helped build the Dublin and Menlo Park teams. I also took part in any number of side projects, like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/how-facebook-hacked-the-nasdaq-button/" target="_blank">hacking the NASDAQ button</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-2012-election-day-through-the-facebook-lens/10151181043778859/" target="_blank">encouraging people to vote in elections</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of those jobs reflect what I love doing - making great software and helping other developers make great software.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoying building civic-minded software like <a href="http://www.whoismytd.com/?utm_source=personal_site&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=homepage" target="_blank">Who is my TD</a>, which is also open sourced as <a href="https://github.com/colmdoyle/pobal" target="_blank">Pobal</a>.
