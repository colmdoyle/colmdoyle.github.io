##  Hello! I'm Colm Doyle, a Software Engineering Manager from Dublin, Ireland.

I lead the App Ecosystem team at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) where I work on Developer Experience and [Intercom Calling](https://www.intercom.com/phone).

Before that I led the Developer Advocacy team at [Slack](https://www.slack.com) and was an early employee at [Kitman Labs](https://kitmanlabs.com) where I led the Engineering team. I was also a founding member of the Developer Support Engineering team at [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com), where I helped build the Dublin and Menlo Park teams before moving into the Product Engineering organization. I also took part in any number of side projects, like [hacking the NASDAQ button](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/how-facebook-hacked-the-nasdaq-button/) and [encouraging people to vote in elections](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-2012-election-day-through-the-facebook-lens/10151181043778859/).

All these jobs reflect what I love doing - making great software and helping other developers make great software.
