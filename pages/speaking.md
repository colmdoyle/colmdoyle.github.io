## Events

If you're interested in having me speak at your event or on your podcast, thank you for considering me! I'm happy to speak at developer focused events where I can participate from Ireland, or where travel and accommodation is provided. If none of the talks below fit the bill, let me know and I'll see if there's something I can speak to. 

## Talks

Here's the talks that I'm currently giving at events

| Talk name     | Length        | Format  |

### Everything is on fire - Don't Panic (How to manage incidents)

**Talk length:**    30 minutes

**Format:**         Presentation

**Abstract**

Any kind of disruption or outage is inherently stressful for your team. Revenue, trust, customer experience - they all take a hit with every minute that passes. In this talk, Colm will speak about how to approach managing incidents that affect everything from small parts of the product to system wide outages, letting teams focus on resolving the problem and not the stress of an incident. He'll talk process and tooling, both from Slack and other well known technology companies.

## Notes

- I will not speak at a conference without a valid and enforceable [code of conduct](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq).
- I will not participate in all male panels.
- I prefer to use my own background when speaking on video and will not use a branded virtual background
