A few weeks ago, I wrote about how [creating more content](/posts/getting-better-at-devrel#create-more-content) was an important practice for those of us who work in Developer Relations. As I alluded to in that article, resurrecting this blog was part of my own routine for creating more content.

In the same vein, I've decided to start publishing a podcast, which I've called [Klokta](/pages/podcast).

## What's in a name?

Settling on Klokta as a name was a bit of a random process. I started looking for a podcast host, and after looking at a few, I settled on using [Anchor](https://anchor.fm), which is the podcasting platform owned by Spotify. I'd heard it mentioned (but not exactly recommended) on [Dithering](https://dithering.fm), so I knew Spotify had some tooling in this area, and it's clearly been an [area of investment](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399123/spotify-podcaster-subscription-fees-revenue) for them of late.

Anyway, part of the signup process there is picking a name for your podcast. I punched in "Colm Doyle" and went through the rest of the process, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt odd about sticking my name on it. It's not like I'm some celebrity where my literal name has any brand value. Could you really hear someone saying "oh you should check out this podcast called 'Colm Doyle'"? No, me either.

I let it rattle around my brain a bit, trying to figure out something that sounded right, before falling back on how I usually pick names for side projects. I picked a word that best described what the project was about....then looked that word up in Irish. I've found this approach usually guarantees a certain amount of uniqueness, particularly in the field of technology.

So, _cleachtadh_ is the irish for _practice_, because I'm practicing content creation. But phonetically I couldn't imagine a native english speaker getting that, so I took the lazy approach and recorded myself saying it, asked my colleagues at Slack to spell it and so I settled on Klokta.

## What will you be talking about?

Well honestly, at the start, I'll likely do audio versions of the blog posts that I publish here, similar to how Ben Thompson records the [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com) newsletter as a podcast. On a side note, if you don't subscribe to Stratechery, you absolutely should, it's a fantastic piece of writing. That and Dithering, they're both superb.

As I get into more of a routine, I'll hopefully branch out the content, interviewing people who I find professionally interesting, so likely folks in the field of DevRel and technology more generally.
