Klokta is a podcast about technology, Developer Relations and more.

As part of my efforts to "[create more content](https://cdoyle.me/posts/getting-better-at-devrel#create-more-content)", I'm always trying new mediums to get a feel for how to best use them, so Klokta is what I use to try out audio content, in the somewhat obvious form of a podcast.

### What's in a name?

Klokta is a phonetic-ish spelling of [cleachtadh](https://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/practice) which is the Irish for "practice". I chose it because it's essentially where I practice the art of audio content creation.
