Kyle Barr, writing for Gizmodo:

> Salesforce confirmed with Gizmodo that the company was hosting a global program to incentivize workers to come into the office, called “Connect for Good.” Fortune originally reported Tuesday based on an internal Slack channel that each employee who decides to actually come to the office between June 12 and 23 will make Salesforce donate $10 to a local charity.

Honestly, it's hard to see this as anything other than emotional blackmail to get people back into the office, an initiative which clearly isn't working out as Salesforce leadership had hoped. 

Consider this reported quote from a Salesforce executive in their Slack instance:

> “By showing up in the office (or for events), you’re strengthening connections and creating a positive wave of change in your community,” the senior executive wrote. “Are you ready to make a real impact by simply showing up?”

RTO is a solution desperately looking for a problem, but if you want to force people back into the office, at least be honest about it and not try to hide behind a veneer of corporate philanthropy.
