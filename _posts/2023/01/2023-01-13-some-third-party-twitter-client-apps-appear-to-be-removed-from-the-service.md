Mitchell Clark, reporting for [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/13/23553161/third-party-twitter-clients-apps-outage-twitterific-tweetbot):

> Some third-party Twitter clients such as Twitterific and Tweetbot appear to be experiencing an outage, though the cause is currently unclear. Developers haven’t received any communication from the company about whether the issue is caused by a bug or something else, according to a [Mastodon post](https://tapbots.social/@paul/109679939029741163) from Paul Haddad, one of Tweetbot’s creators.

After my positive experience with [Ivory](https://cdoyle.me/2023/01/12/tapbots-share-a-roadmap-for-their-mastodon-client-ivory/) of late, and the truly awful new home screen experience that Twitter is [currently rolling out](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23549368/twitter-for-you-page-tiktok-following-tab) to iOS users, I was considering switching to Tweetbot, but I guess I'll hold off for now.

It's reasonable to suggest that this is just a minor glitch and when San Francisco starts to wake up it'll be resolved, but it seems coincidental in the extreme that a bug would occur that appears to **only** impacts the most popular third party Twitter clients just as they're rolling out a new home screen experience that introduces an algorithmic feed which has historically been resisted by a decent chunk of Twitter power users.
