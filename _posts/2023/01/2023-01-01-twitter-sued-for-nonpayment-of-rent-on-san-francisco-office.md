Robert Burnson, reporting for [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-31/twitter-sued-for-nonpayment-of-rent-on-san-francisco-office?sref=ExbtjcSG):

> Twitter hasnâ€™t paid rent on its headquarters, or any of its other global offices, in weeks, the New York Times reported on Dec. 13. The company was also sued earlier this month for refusing to pay for two charter flights.

Twitter potentially getting kicked out of offices mere weeks after insisting everyone has to return to the office full time is about as hilarious as it is sad.

This is in addition to reports that Musk has cut things like cleaning services at the offices, leading to employees [bringing in their own toilet paper](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/technology/twitter-elon-musk.html).

I have to imagine the combination of forcing people back to offices and not cleaning those same offices is ripe for a [constructive dismissal](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html) case, in EU member states anyway.
