> Twitterâ€™s staff spent years trying to protect the social media site against impulsive billionaires who wanted to use the reach of its platform for their own ends, and then one made himself the CEO.

I'm a little late sharing this as it was published earlier this week, but it's a fantastic insight into the first few months of Elon Musk's tenure at Twitter. 

Personally, I read this as a cautionary tale of how to run a service into the ground, but I can definitely imagine there's many CEOs, especially in the tech industry, who will read this and think it's a blueprint for success.

And those CEOs are, to my mind anyway, unfit to call themselves leaders.
