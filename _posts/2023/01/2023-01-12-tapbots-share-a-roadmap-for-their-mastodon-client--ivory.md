I've been using Ivory as my main Mastodon client on iOS for the last week or two, and it's very polished given that it's still consider alpha/beta. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, given that it's from the same team that makes Tweetbot, but it's still nice to see.

I will say that it's a much more Twitter-esque way of consuming Mastodon, which won't be for everyone, but for those of us with one foot in each ecosystem, it does make it a bit easier to switch between the two.
