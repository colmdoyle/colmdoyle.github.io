This [cartoon](https://workchronicles.com/access-denied/) by [Work Chronicles](https://workchronicles.com/) is I assume designed as light humour, but think how far we've fallen as an industry when it's a reality for many that they will find out they are laid because their access to the company's systems is revoked.
