Just a delightful little bit of Developer Experience from the [Spotify Developer Relations Team](https://developer.spotify.com). Simple and to the point.

Demonstrates four different things you can do with the API, and combines them to also demonstrate how you can use them together for a practical benefit.

Just perfect, no tweaking needed. Everyone there should be proud of this.
