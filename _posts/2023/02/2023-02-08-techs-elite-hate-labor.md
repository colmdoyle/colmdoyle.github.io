Ed Z writing over on [their substack](https://ez.substack.com/p/techs-elite-hates-labor)

> Yes, the tech industry’s loudest guys have all been demanding a "great reset," where efficiency reigns, where the entitled are not invested in, or are fired, or, let’s be honest, are "put in their place" because the overwhelming sense from these craven ghouls is that they believe that workers got given way too much and were treated too well. 

Ooof, Ed definitely doesn't pull any punches here, but they're definitely hitting close to the mark. Some organisations may well be cutting only as deep as they need to survive, but for the vast majority of cases, I have to agree, it's basically just a power play.
