I've always had a passing interest in how physical spaces are designed. From the giant social experiment that is a Disney theme park, to the way a grocery store is designed, to the desk layout in a small office, I find it fascinating how the design of a space can influence the way people interact with each other.

I am now, and continue to be, an [advocate](https://cdoyle.me/2023/02/08/why-is-remote-work-seen-as-a-gift/) for enabling people to work from anywhere. The benefits provided in terms of focus, a broader hiring pool and greater access to opportunities for people are too great to ignore. But I do wonder what we lose when we don't have the opportunity to bump into each other in the hallway, or have a conversation at the coffee machine.

I was once told that when Facebook designed their offices, they spread out the kitchens so that people on unrelated teams would frequently bump into each other. The idea being that this would foster serendipitous conversations that would lead to new ideas. I don't know if this is true, but I do know that I've had many conversations in the kitchen at work that have led to new ideas, or new ways of thinking about a problem.

As a relatively extroverted person, I'll admit I sometimes struggle with working from home. I enjoy these moments of serendipity that the Facebook kitchens were designed to foster. I enjoy the opportunity to have a conversation with someone that I wouldn't have otherwise had. I enjoy the opportunity to learn something new, or to share something I've learned with someone else. I've tried to replicate it with things like Slack Huddles, or Zoom coffee chats, but it's not the same. They all feel forced in a way that bumping into someone at the coffee machine doesn't.

I don't know what the answer is. I don't know if there is an answer. I do know that I miss these moments of serendipity, and I hope that we can find a way to bring them back into our lives without taking the lazy way out and just going back to the office.
