There's been a [lot of talk](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-scoop-rto/) about what is going to happen with return to office plans in the new year, with many companies mandating that employees come back in.

Much of the public commentary from various CEOs has been around "the value of in-person collaboration", but it's hard to wonder if it's less to do with that and more to do with the fact that these same companies have sunk millions into office space and are now trying to recoup some of that investment.
