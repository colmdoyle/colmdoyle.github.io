[Dan Primack](https://twitter.com/danprimack) reporting over at Axios -

>Twitter has stopped paying the rent on some of its office leases and hasn't paid numerous other vendors since Elon Musk acquired the company in late October, Axios has learned from multiple sources.
>
>Why it matters: One of the world's richest men isn't honoring financial obligations made to those with far fewer resources.

Honestly, it shocks me not one bit that the Man Child would be the type of person to leave people short when it comes to paying bills.

Think about it, you can totally see him not tipping at a restaurant can't you?
