[Followgraph](https://followgraph.vercel.app) is a new tool from [Gabi Purcaru](https://mastodon.online/@gabipurcaru) that helps you discover new people to follow on Mastodon. The decentralised nature of Mastodon makes it hard to do this kind of discovery, so it's good to see someone trying to solve this problem.

One particularly nice feature of the tool is that it doesn't require any kind of privileged access to your account. It uses public data from the Mastodon API to find people you might like to follow.
