Jay Peters, reporting for [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/19/23517306/twitter-square-profile-pictures-update):

>Twitter is adding to its increasingly complex ways of differentiating accounts with new square profile pictures with rounded corners for brands. The new type of profile pic started rolling out on the platform on Monday, and you might already be able to see them on brand profiles and in your feed.

The product development "process" at Twitter over the last few weeks kind of reminds me of the chaotic energy of a hackathon, where people are just building and shipping whatever idea comes into their head and moving onto the next thing on their list.

Fun for a while, but not exactly a sustainable way to build a product.
