Howard Fendrich reporting for the Associated Press - 

> The first five episodes — focusing on Melbourne Park, Indian Wells, Madrid and Roland Garros — will be available next month. The season’s other five installments — which look at Wimbledon, Eastbourne, Queens Club, the U.S. Open, WTA Finals and ATP Finals — arrive in June.

Althought I haven't watched [Formula 1: Drive to survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890), I've heard nothing but good things about it, which means I'm stupidly excited to watch this new tennis version from the same team - "[Break Point](https://www.netflix.com/title/81569920)".

Should be a very pleasant appetizer to the 2023 Australian Open, which somewhat controversially includes Novak Djokovic, despite [his deportation](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/novak-djokovic-to-be-deported-from-australia-after-losing-appeal-against-visa-cancellation) before the 2022 Open.
