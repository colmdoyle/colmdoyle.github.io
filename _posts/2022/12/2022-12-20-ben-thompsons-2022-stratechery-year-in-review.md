Ben Thompson has published this year's edition of his annual Stratechery year in review, and it's well worth a read to see what you're missing out on if you aren't a subscriber. I've been one for a few years now, and I've never regretted it. With this year's changes to bundle in the [Dithering](http://dithering.fm) podcast he co-hosts with John Gruber, as well as the fact he publishes his content across so many mediums (podcast/newsletter/website), it's even better value than ever.
