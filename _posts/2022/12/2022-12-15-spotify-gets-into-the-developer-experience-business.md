Tyson Singer, writing for Spotify on the Spotify engineering blog:

> First, the basics: 
>
> - These new plugins are made to work with Backstage, the open source platform for developer portals that we donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 
> - Plugins are how you add functionality to Backstage, from security alerts to integrating with CI/CD. 
> - Anyone can make their own bespoke plugins or get free ones from the Backstage open source Plugin Marketplace. 
> And, as of today, you can also buy plugins made by Spotify.

[Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com) has always struck me as a strange endeavour. I get why Spotify would have bespoke internal tooling, and I get why they would open source it, but they always seemed to be a little *too* invested in making it successful. It appeared to have a handful of employees who sole focus was driving adoption. Which even for a major company’s internal tooling was a bit random.

But I guess now they’ve taken it a step further and are literally trying to create a revenue stream out of it. I can’t imagine it’s going to be in any way significant to their bottom line, so I wonder how long will it be before someone starts wondering if it’s worth the investment and the team working on it get moved over to a part of the core business.

In a way, it feels a bit like [Workplace by Meta](https://www.workplace.com), which was a commercialization of how Facebook had been using the [Groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/explore/) product for internal use. Sure, it brought in some amount of revenue, and would probably have been a respectably profitable company by itself, but it was nothing compared to the firehose of cash that is the Ads business and I therefore always expected it to be shutdown as a distraction to the core business.
