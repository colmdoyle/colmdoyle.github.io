> Twitter will be shutting down its newsletter product, known as Revue. Reports have been saying that the service would be axed for over a month, but now we finally have confirmation and a date: January 12th, 2023.
>
>People won’t be able to access their accounts after that date, and all the service’s data will be deleted, according to a help article on the Revue site. Before then, authors who used the service will be able to download lists of their subscribers, as well as an archive that includes their analytics and writing. Revue also alerted its users to this information via email and has said that it’ll cancel paid newsletter subscriptions starting December 20th, so people won’t be charged for newsletters they won’t get.

Given that Musk supposedly wants Twitter to be a home for longer form content (up to 4,000 characters), and that he's suggested he would buy Substack, this seems counterintuitive.

But then again, it hasn't at any point seemed like Musk is playing some advanced 3D chess with Twitter, it feels more like he's just burning it to the ground through incompetence, so maybe this is just more evidence of stumbling from mistake to mistake.
