If you're one of the tiny group of people the internet who read what I publish here, you may notice a change starting this week.

Other than the visual refresh, I've decided to start posting links to things on the internet that interest me, similar to how [John Gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber) does on [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net). Essentially the feed of posts will be a mix of my own original writing, mixed in with direct links to things and my observations on them. You'll be able to distingush these becase they'll have a â˜… after the title in the header, and if you click the header it'll send you directly to the page I'm discussing.

As for the why, well first of all it's just a habit I want to get into, but secondly, whilst I don't think twitter is going away any time soon, all the recent [chaos there](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/06/1140999993/the-chaos-at-twitter) did get me thinking about how much of my own observations would be lost if it **did** disappear, so I decided that I wanted to be the source of truth for those, and simply cross post to the relevant social network.
