Monique Judge, writing for [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging):

> In the beginning, there were blogs, and they were the original social web. We built community. We found our people. We wrote personally. We wrote frequently. We self-policed, and we linked to each other so that newbies could discover new and good blogs.

I remember keeping a blog in my teens, including on GeoCities, and I do wonder if the argument above will be my generation’s "It was better in my day". Every generation since mine has grown up on the web, so it’s only natural that when we get nostalgic for the past, it’s going to be about some aspect of our online experiences.

And honestly, I do remember the internet being, I dunno, **friendlier** back then. There’s still pockets of it to be sure, but by and large discussions on the internet can sometimes be more stress than it’s worth these days.

Regardless, this article really resonated with me and is a far more eloquent description of [why I started to move almost all my writing here]({% post_url /2022/12/2022-12-14-a-change-in-approach %}) and off things like twitter threads.
