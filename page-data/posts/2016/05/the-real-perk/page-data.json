I got to regularly hear from the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Mike Schroepfer, Chris Cox and Sheryl Sandberg.</p>\n<figure class=\"float-right\" style=\"width: 240px\">\n\t<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source srcset=\"/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/8ac56/zuck-qanda.webp 240w,\n/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/d3be9/zuck-qanda.webp 480w,\n/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/e46b2/zuck-qanda.webp 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n          <source srcset=\"/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/09b79/zuck-qanda.jpg 240w,\n/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/7cc5e/zuck-qanda.jpg 480w,\n/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/6a068/zuck-qanda.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" type=\"image/jpeg\">\n          <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"/static/3a95259460150c4feb4880a096d4392b/6a068/zuck-qanda.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Zuckerberg answering questions at a Town Hall\" title=\"Mark Zuckerberg answering questions at a Town Hall\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\">\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n\t<figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg answering questions at a Town Hall.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>And those are just the people who are widely known.

I’m lucky to have heard her speak on so many occasions.</p>\n<p>I guess the point I’m trying to make here is that, when you’re evaluating opportunities at a company, especially early on in your career, be sure to look beyond what’s in your contract.</p>\n<p>Salary, benefits, perks etc are important and should of course be a part of your decision, but focus more on the product or service, and the people who have already chosen to be involved with the company. The lessons you will learn from being surrounded by smart people and leaders in their field will stay with you long after you have finished your last free meal or spent your final paycheque from that company.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2016/05/the-real-perk","tagSlugs":["/tag/career-development/","/tag/startups/","/tag/facebook/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-05-16T23:46:37.121Z","description":"Tech companies do a fantastic job on their career sites of talking about all the amazing perks they offer.
